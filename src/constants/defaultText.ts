When Sara entered the drawing room the next morning everybody looked at her with wide, interested eyes.

One thing was plain, they did not know what to make of her or what to think, and Captain Crewe seemed to understand this perfectly; he saw the wonder in their faces, though they did not seem quite sure about her manners or her ways.

If Sara had been a different kind of child, her life at Miss Minchin's Select Seminary for Young Ladies during the next few years would not have been at all good for her.

Of course the greatest power Sara possessed and the one which gained her even more followers than the beauty, was the fact that she never, under any circumstances whatsoever, lost her temper.

When Sara first left France to go to Miss Minchin's school in London, she spoke French much better than she spoke English; it was her father's native tongue.

The first night she spent in her attic was a thing Sara never forgot.

The next morning Becky was awakened by being gently shaken.

It was the third person in the trio who told her that her father was dead.

After that it was a positive thing for Ermengarde and Lottie to make themselves at home in Sara's attic. It was the only place in which they felt they could speak with real freedom of their woes.`
